# bulleted-list

Bulleted List is a custom Salesforce Marketing Cloud Content Builder block using the [blocksdk](https://github.com/salesforce-marketingcloud/blocksdk).

Bulleted List creates an email-ready bulleted list.  Unlike the bulleted list that can be access via the WYSIWYG Freeform Editor, the list generated by this content block will work with almost all email clients.
